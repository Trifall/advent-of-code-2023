# Jerren Trifan's Advent-of-Code 2023

This is my Advent of Code solutions for December 2023 in TypeScript. Turned off Copilot for these solutions.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run ./src/day<number>.ts
```

## File/Folder Structure

All relevant files are in the src folder.

- Source files are in the format of ```day<number>.ts```

- Data is in the format of ```day<number>_data.txt```

- Instructions are in the format of ```day<number>_instructions.txt```

- ```_util.ts``` contains a file loading wrapper function
